## Configuration
### Prerequisites
- SRW: `git clone https://github.com/ochubar/SRW.git`
- Skimage:
- Pytorch == 1.4.0:

### Add `SRW` as Python Package
Before testing the propagation parameter optimization, you should 
add `SRW` as a package of your Python. This can be achieved by 
copying the `SRW.pth` into the site-packages folder of your Python
and change the path as `PATH_TO_SRW\env\work\srw_python` in `SRW.pth` to the path of the SRW package after
the git.
