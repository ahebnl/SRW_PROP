# SRW_PROP
This project contains several tools to optimize the propagation parameters
of SRW simulator.


## Configuration
### Prerequisites
- SRW: `git clone https://github.com/ochubar/SRW.git`
- Skimage:

### Add `SRW` as Python Package
Before testing the propagation parameter optimization, you should 
add `SRW` as a package of your Python. This can be achieved by 
copying the `SRW.pth` into the site-packages folder of your Python
and change the path as `PATH_TO_SRW\env\work\srw_python` in `SRW.pth` to the path of the SRW package after
the git.

## #20200405
- Two-reward paradigm works fine on `CHX`, `ESM` and `FMX` beamlines.
- Two-reward paradigm is unable to run on `CSX` beamline. The reason is  for 
the initial values, the output image is blank. 

## #20200420
- Use an unified loss function for all parameters.
- Coordinate Ascent method works on `FMX`, `FMX-2`, `ESM`, `CHX`, `HXN`, `SMI`.
- Dont't work on `CSX` because the image is all zero if the parameters are not appropriate.
- Have less satisfied result on `SRX`.
- Should we tune the alpha parameters of the reward for different expriments?

Questions:
- In `HXN`, `SRX` file, there are several generated `.dat` files, should we consider all of them? Some 
files lose the dimension information.

## #20200510
Changes:
- When computing the complexity, only concerns the tuned parameter lists.
